"""Challenge, use all the assignment operators to change 
the value of a `number` variable, but the final result will be the same as the 
starting number. Feel free to print `number` to the console after each 
operation to see its value."""

# The `number` variable will start as fifty
number = 50
# Use the floor division assignment operator to divide `number` by 8
number //= 8  # this return whole number result
# Use the addition assignment operator to increase `number` by 29
number += 29
# Use the subtraction assignment operator to reduce `number` by 20
number -= 20
# Use the multiplication assignment operator to triple `number`
number *= 3
# Use the exponentiation assignment operator to raise `number` to the third power
number **= 3
# Use the modulus assignment operator to divide `number` by 727 and get the remainder
number %= 727
# Use the division assignment operator to divide `number` by 5
number /= 5
