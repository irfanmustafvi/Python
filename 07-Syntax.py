# Key aspects of Python syntax

##Indentation: Python uses indentation to define the structure of code blocks.
###Example of Indentation: if x > 10:  do something

##Statements: A complete instruction that performs an action.
###Example of Statement:  x = 25

##Expression: A combination of values, variables, and operators that produce a result.
###Example of Expression: x + 5
###Statement containing an expression: y = x + 5

##Comments: Add notes that explain the purpose of code.
###Example of Comment: #This is a comment & """This is a multi-line comment"""

x = 5
if x > 4:
    print("x is greater than 5")  # standard 4 space identation
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")  # 12 space identation
    print("Hi")
else:
    print("x is less then 5")  # 1 space identation
